# Q_Move
A Quake-like controller for Godot.

Btan2 is working on the physics overhaul for Godot 4. I made this branch to contribute some improvements that I think other people might want for the Godot 3.X version of Q_Move.

### Changes and Improvements (So Far):
  - Normalized mouse sensitivity so sensitivity remains consistent across various monitor resolutions
  - Gamepad support for basic movement and camera looking
